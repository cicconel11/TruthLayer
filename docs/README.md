## Key Concepts

### Search Engine Bias Measurement

TruthLayer measures bias across three primary dimensions:

- **Source Diversity**: How varied are the information sources returned by search engines?
- **Engine Independence**: How much do different search engines overlap in their results?
- **Factual Reliability**: How factually accurate and reliable are the returned results?

### Systematic Approach

Our methodology ensures:

- **Reproducibility**: All procedures are documented and can be independently replicated
- **Transparency**: Complete methodology and data are publicly available
- **Scientific Rigor**: Statistical validation and peer review of all methods
- **Ethical Compliance**: Respectful data collection and responsible use guidelines

### Multi-Engine Coverage

TruthLayer analyzes results from:

- **Google Search**: Dominant traditional search engine
- **Bing Search**: Microsoft's search platform
- **Perplexity AI**: AI-powered conversational search
- **Brave Search**: Privacy-focused independent search

## Data and Analysis

### Dataset Characteristics

- **Scale**: Millions of search results across thousands of queries
- **Temporal Coverage**: Continuous collection since January 2025
- **Topic Diversity**: Health, politics, technology, and science domains
