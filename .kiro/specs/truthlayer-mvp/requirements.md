# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TruthLayer is an infrastructure system for search and AI transparency that creates auditable datasets and bias metrics to reveal how information visibility differs across search engines and AI models over time. The system serves as an observability layer for algorithms that shape public knowledge by continuously collecting, annotating, and analyzing search results from multiple engines to quantify and visualize bias patterns.

## Glossary

- **TruthLayer_System**: The complete infrastructure for collecting, processing, and analyzing search engine and AI model results
- **Multi_Engine_Collector**: Component that scrapes and normalizes results from Google, Bing, Perplexity, and Brave search engines
- **Annotation_Pipeline**: LLM-powered system that classifies search results by factual consistency and domain type
- **Bias_Metrics_Engine**: Component that calculates domain diversity, engine overlap, and factual alignment indices
- **Transparency_Dashboard**: Web interface displaying bias metrics, visualizations, and trend analysis
- **Search_Result**: Individual result item containing rank, title, snippet, URL, engine, and timestamp
- **Domain_Diversity**: Metric measuring the variety of unique sources returned for a query
- **Engine_Overlap**: Metric measuring shared results across different search engines
- **Factual_Alignment**: Metric measuring annotation agreement on factual consistency
- **Benchmark_Query_Set**: Curated collection of queries across topics like health, elections, climate, and AI

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher studying algorithmic bias, I want to collect normalized search results from multiple engines, so that I can analyze how different platforms present information differently.

2. THE Annotation_Pipeline SHALL evaluate each Search_Result for factual consistency using LLM analysis
3. THE Annotation_Pipeline SHALL version all prompts and model IDs for reproducibility
4. THE Annotation_Pipeline SHALL aggregate individual result scores into query-level metrics
5. THE Annotation_Pipeline SHALL cache annotated results to minimize processing costs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a media analyst, I want to see quantified bias metrics across search engines, so that I can measure and report on information visibility differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Bias_Metrics_Engine SHALL calculate Domain_Diversity as the count of unique sources per query
2. THE Bias_Metrics_Engine SHALL calculate Engine_Overlap as the percentage of shared results across engines
3. THE Bias_Metrics_Engine SHALL calculate Factual_Alignment as the agreement score from annotation analysis
4. THE Bias_Metrics_Engine SHALL track metric changes over time to identify bias patterns
5. THE Bias_Metrics_Engine SHALL generate comparative analysis between different search engines

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a transparency advocate, I want to visualize bias metrics through an interactive dashboard, so that I can explore and share findings about search engine differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. THE Transparency_Dashboard SHALL provide interactive filtering by search engine and topic category
3. THE Transparency_Dashboard SHALL visualize metric trends over time using charts and graphs
4. THE Transparency_Dashboard SHALL enable CSV export of underlying data for reproducibility
5. THE Transparency_Dashboard SHALL update automatically when new data is processed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated data collection and processing, so that the system maintains current bias measurements without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TruthLayer_System SHALL execute automated data collection on a scheduled basis using CRON or Cloud Run
2. THE TruthLayer_System SHALL process collected data through the Annotation_Pipeline automatically
3. THE TruthLayer_System SHALL update bias metrics and dashboard visualizations after each collection cycle
4. THE TruthLayer_System SHALL log collection status and alert on failed scraping attempts
5. THE TruthLayer_System SHALL validate data integrity using content hashes and completeness checks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want access to versioned datasets and transparency reports, so that I can conduct independent analysis and cite reliable sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TruthLayer_System SHALL maintain versioned Parquet datasets for efficient analytics access
2. THE TruthLayer_System SHALL generate a public "Search Transparency Report 2025" with key findings
3. THE TruthLayer_System SHALL include visualizations of domain shifts and visibility differences in reports
